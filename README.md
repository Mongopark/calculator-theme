## What the code does

This is a simple calculator on the web, built with react js as a web application. This calculator has different themes, does mathematical calculations and has states/effecs when buttons are clicked

## Reasoning Behind my Technical choice

The frameworks and languages used in the creation of this web application is react js, bootstrap, javascript, html, css etc. The reason i used these is because;
1. Javascript is a very powerful language and will help with the algorithm
2. React js has reusable components that would make the app components reusable thereby making it easier to build
3. Bootstrap is not the best css framework but it is fast


## Trade-offs that could have been made/ things i would have done differently if given more time

Actually, i could easily add a dark and light theme to the app, also i could easily make it a scientific calculator instead of a simple calculator, but i choose not to not because of time but because i am an instruction oriented engineer and thus would not different from what i was instructed
